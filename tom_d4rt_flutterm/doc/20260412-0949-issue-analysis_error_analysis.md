# 20260412-0949-issue-analysis Error Analysis

Scope: Batch-0 only (issues 0..4 from `20260412-0949-issue-analysis_test_summary.md`).

## Batch-0

### Index 0

- Index: 0
- testname: `(setUpAll)` in `test/essential_classes_test.dart`
- category: `TEST-HARNESS-LOG-ONLY`
- immediate fix possible: `yes`
- description: Non-failing setup output is classified as an issue because Batch indexing includes tests with any non-metric log output.
- detailed analysis what the problem is: The logged message (`Bridge regeneration skipped: all bridge outputs are up-to-date`) is operational and expected. It is not a runtime, bridge, generator, interpreter, or Flutter framework failure. This is a logging-classification problem in the test harness/reporting pipeline.
- fix description (if clear): Mark this exact setup message as informational in the issue indexer (or filter it from issue extraction), while still keeping it in raw logs for traceability.
- need for deeper analysis?: `no`
- batch number: `0`

### Index 1

- Index: 1
- testname: `cupertino/controls_test.dart`
- category: `TEST-SCRIPT-LAYOUT-CONSTRAINTS`
- immediate fix possible: `yes`
- description: Test passed, but framework emitted 5 errors: negative minimum height constraints, `_RenderEditableCustomPaint` not laid out, and semantics lifecycle assertion.
- detailed analysis what the problem is: This is primarily a script-level widget composition issue, not a plain assertion failure in the test harness. The error chain (`negative minimum height` -> `RenderBox was not laid out` -> semantics assertion) indicates invalid layout constraints around editable/text input render objects. This does not match known bridge or interpreter limitations; it is consistent with Flutter layout misuse in the script setup.
- fix description (if clear): Rework the script's editable/control layout to guarantee bounded and non-negative height constraints (for example, explicit `SizedBox`/`ConstrainedBox` bounds, avoiding conflicting nested constraints in form rows). Add assertions in the script that no framework errors are collected from the test runner.
- need for deeper analysis?: `yes` (only if warnings remain after script constraint cleanup)
- batch number: `0`

### Index 2

- Index: 2
- testname: `cupertino/form_test.dart`
- category: `TEST-SCRIPT-LAYOUT-CONSTRAINTS`
- immediate fix possible: `yes`
- description: Test passed, but framework emitted 17 errors with the same pattern as Index 1, indicating repeated invalid constraints around editable render objects.
- detailed analysis what the problem is: High count and repeated identical messages indicate multiple widgets in this script are built under bad constraints. This is still script-level behavior (layout contract violations) and not a bridge/generator/interpreter defect. The repeated failures suggest one shared construction pattern in the form test is applied multiple times.
- fix description (if clear): Extract and fix the common Cupertino form field builder used in this script; enforce positive min-height and bounded width/height for editable nodes. Add a post-run check in the script to fail if framework error lines are produced.
- need for deeper analysis?: `yes` (if common builder fix does not eliminate all warnings)
- batch number: `0`

### Index 3

- Index: 3
- testname: `cupertino/textfield_test.dart`
- category: `TEST-SCRIPT-LAYOUT-CONSTRAINTS`
- immediate fix possible: `yes`
- description: Test passed, but framework emitted 13 errors (negative min-height constraints, render object not laid out, semantics assertion).
- detailed analysis what the problem is: Same root signature as Index 1 and 2, strongly suggesting a shared text-field composition approach causing invalid constraints in one or more states of the scenario. No signal here that this is due to bridge registration gaps, generator defects, or interpreter type-casting limitations.
- fix description (if clear): Align text field test scaffolding with Flutter constraint requirements (explicit parent constraints, avoid unconstrained editable descendants). Consolidate with the same layout helper fix used for controls/form scripts to remove duplicated failure patterns.
- need for deeper analysis?: `yes` (only if errors persist after shared layout helper correction)
- batch number: `0`

### Index 4

- Index: 4
- testname: `rendering/viewport_test.dart`
- category: `TEST-SCRIPT-OVERFLOW`
- immediate fix possible: `yes`
- description: Test passed, but framework emitted repeated overflow warnings (`A RenderFlex overflowed by 20 pixels on the right.`).
- detailed analysis what the problem is: Overflow warnings indicate the scripted viewport demo composes child layout wider than available width. This is a script layout scenario issue and is not categorized as interpreter/bridge/generator failure. Because the test still passes, this must be treated as a quality issue in the test scenario rather than a hard runtime failure.
- fix description (if clear): Constrain child width in the viewport scenario (`Expanded`/`Flexible`, wrapping, responsive constraints, or horizontal scroll strategy) so render overflow is eliminated. Add guard checks to flag overflow warnings as failures when running the script.
- need for deeper analysis?: `no`
- batch number: `0`

## Batch-0 Classification Summary

- Bridge issue classification: no direct bridge registration gap identified in Batch-0.
- Generator issue classification: no generator defect signal identified in Batch-0.
- Interpreter issue classification: no direct interpreter limitation signature identified in Batch-0 (for example, no non-exhaustive switch, no generic callback cast mismatch, no missing bridged method/runtime signature tied to known interpreter docs).
- Primary problem class for Batch-0: test script and harness quality (layout constraint misuse, overflow handling, and informational setup log classification).
