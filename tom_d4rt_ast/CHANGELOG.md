## 0.1.6

- Mirror the `tom_d4rt 1.8.22` interpreter fixes: instance members shadow
  bridged top-level functions (FIX-20260613-1038-C); no exception-as-control-
  flow on implicit-`this` reads.
- Mirror the `tom_d4rt 1.8.22` performance work: per-instance bound-method
  tear-off cache, no-binding `Environment` frame collapse, no primitive-operand
  wrapping in binary expressions.
- Documentation: limitations consolidated; user guide and README updated to
  point at `tom_d4rt`'s canonical limitations reference.

## 0.1.5

- Consume `tom_ast_model ^0.1.1` for the `StaticResolver` slot-resolution
  members (`resolvedSlot` / `declSlot`); the AST-driven `InterpreterVisitor`
  now serves resolved reads from frame slots instead of name-map walks.
- Mirror the `tom_d4rt 1.8.21` interpreter fixes (redirecting factories,
  sibling static-field writes, native-side reset).

## 0.1.4

- First public release on pub.dev.
- Kept in sync with `tom_d4rt` interpreter fixes (generic type matching,
  enum handling, `isSubtypeOf` superclass-chain walk, stdlib native names).
- AST-driven `InterpreterVisitor` executes the analyzer-free mirror AST
  (`SAstNode`) with full bridging, permissions, and callable support.

## 0.1.1

- Support extensible dart: library bridges - unknown dart: URIs now check for bridged content before throwing an error
- Allows external packages (like tom_d4rt_flutterm) to register bridges for dart:ui and other dart: libraries

## 1.0.0

- Initial version.
