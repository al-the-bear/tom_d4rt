## 0.1.4

- First public release on pub.dev.
- Kept in sync with `tom_d4rt` interpreter fixes (generic type matching,
  enum handling, `isSubtypeOf` superclass-chain walk, stdlib native names).
- AST-driven `InterpreterVisitor` executes the analyzer-free mirror AST
  (`SAstNode`) with full bridging, permissions, and callable support.

## 0.1.1

- Support extensible dart: library bridges - unknown dart: URIs now check for bridged content before throwing an error
- Allows external packages (like tom_d4rt_flutterm) to register bridges for dart:ui and other dart: libraries

## 1.0.0

- Initial version.
